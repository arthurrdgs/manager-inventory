## How to use this project:

This code assumes that you have a text file named 'inventory.txt', so make sure of that! 

And inside this file there's data of all the products in stock as shown in the image below:

Once the code runs, the data from the text file will be read automatically and the user will be given a menu of options to excecute a specific task, just like shown in the following image:

From that, the user just needs to select what task is to be performed and it will excecute according to the 'inventory.txt' text file.

The example below shows the task being excecuted if the user enters 'v' to view all shoes in the inventory:
